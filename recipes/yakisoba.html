        <h2>What is yakisoba?</h2>
        <p><strong>Yakisoba</strong> is a popular Japanese stir-fried noodle dish made with wheat-based noodles, sliced meat (often pork), vegetables like cabbage and carrots, and a savory-sweet sauce similar to Worcestershire. It's commonly served at festivals, food stalls, and as a quick comfort food at home.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ lb sliced pork belly (or your choice of protein)</li>
            <li>½ onion</li>
            <li>4 inches carrot</li>
            <li>¼ head green cabbage</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>
            <li>3 shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp neutral oil (plus more, if needed)</li>
            <li>3 servings yakisoba noodles</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅓ cup yakisoba sauce</li>
            <li>aonori (optional)</li>
            <li>pickled red ginger (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice pork belly and vegetables into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Loosen and warm the pre-steamed yakisoba noodles in the pan, then transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>Stir-fry pork belly first until mostly cooked; then add harder vegetables, followed by softer ones.</li>
            <li>Return noodles to the pan, drizzle with ⅓ cup yakisoba sauce, and toss everything together until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with optional toppings (aonori and/or pickled red ginger).</li>
        </ol>
