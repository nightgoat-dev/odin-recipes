        <h2>What is chicken katsu?</h2>
        <p><strong>Chicken katsu</strong> is a Japanese dish consisting of a breaded and deep-fried chicken cutlet. The chicken is coated in flour, egg, and panko breadcrumbs before being fried to a crispy, golden brown. It is often served with a tangy tonkatsu sauce and shredded cabbage.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 piece boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 cups neutral oil (for deep-frying)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup panko</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>½ Tbsp neutral oil (for the egg)</li>
            <li>tonkatsu sauce</li>
            <li>shredded green cabbage</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice boneless, skinless chicken breasts horizontally to create thin cutlets. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Arrange three shallow dishes: one with all-purpose flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with panko breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Dredge each chicken cutlet in flour, ensuring a light, even coating. Dip into the beaten eggs, allowing excess to drip off. Finally, coat thoroughly with panko, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
            <li>In a deep skillet or frying pan, heat neutral oil to 340ºF (170ºC).</li>
            <li>Carefully place the breaded cutlets into the hot oil. Fry for a total of 3 minutes, flipping it over at the halfway point.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked cutlets to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Slice into strips and serve with tonktasu sauce and shredded cabbage.</li>
        </ol>
